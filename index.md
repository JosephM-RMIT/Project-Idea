# Project Idea


## Overview:

My aim for this project is to create a 2D platforming game using Java script. The game will be programmed using the Eclipse Java Integrated Development Environment. My current vision for this is to create a game similar to those of the early 80s—with enemies to dodge, power-ups to grab and platforms to jump on to. Of course, this will be my own take on the game and provide unique combinations of mechanics such as extra skills that may be unlocked through difficult areas.  

## Motivation:


I have always been drawn to games ever since I was a small child, when I played Abe’s Odyssey and Skull Monkeys on the original PlayStation. According to sources, since those days in the early 90s, the video games industry has grown from a $7 billion USD market in 1995 to a whopping $137.9 billion in 2018. Moreover, NewZoo, a global leader in games and e-sport market analysis has estimated that the industry will grow to over $180.1 billion USD by 2021. This makes the video games industry one of the fasted growing components of the international media sector. With a huge amount of growth and an increasing market potential, I believe that there is a large market new and innovative projects within the realm of games.

## Description:

This game will be a 2D platforming game with elements of the classic rogue-like series of old.

The player will control the main unnamed protagonist of the series using keyboard inputs to move the character around, shoot projectiles and make choices throughout the game. The following ‘classic’ movement/interaction keybindings will be used. 

“←” (Left arrow key) = Move character left

“→” (Right arrow key) = Move character right

“_” (Space bar) = Make character jump

“↑” (Up arrow) =  Interact

“↓” (Down arrow) = Duck

“V” (‘V’ Key) = Shoot projectiles

“B” (‘B’ Key) = Power-up

“C” (‘C’ Key) = Reload

The player will begin his play through stranded on an unknown land, requiring them to use the limited resources around them to progress through the various levels of the game. The game will require a careful juggling act – causing the player to balance the resources given to them while not hindering them from still being able to progress through the game. 

The main combat mechanic of the game will revolve around standard projectile shooting with the addition of limited ammunition. This would mean that the player must be careful with his use of attacks lest they be stranded with nothing to help progress through the world. Additional drops of ammunition and other useful items like power-ups and extra lives will come from both events within the game and successful elimination of enemies. This will hopefully cause a choice within the player to attempt to eliminate enemies for the possibility of drops or to attempt to skip them if possible.

The use of rare power-ups and Item drops for the player provide an incentive to risk certain actions for the possibility of benefit. Elements of randomness tastefully sprinkled throughout will also provide repeatability and will help to prevent monotony.  Areas of interest will also feature within this game, with random possibilities of both positive and negative effects to happen. This can also add another element of game-play, possibly opening up strategies involving calculated risk to attempt for something lucky. 

## Tools and Technologies:

Currently, the software needed for this project would be some form of Java Integrated Development Environment to program the game from the ground up. The most promising software for this is venture is called Eclipse. Eclipse is an Open-source software development kit used for Java programming. Invented in 2001 by IBM, it is still widely used and supported by a large range of software vendors and receives updates regularly. Furthermore, if this project was to be undertaken by a team of developers, an online repository such as GitHub may prove to be useful when attempting to share revisions of code chunks.

## Skills Required:

The main skills needed for this project are skills pertaining to Java programming. Additionally, creating a game with a wide scale and interactive mechanics is a time consuming process for a single person to achieve. It would be beneficial to gather a group of like-minded developers with similar interests to work with. One of the main benefits of this project is the lack of monetary investment required all of the skills and programs required are available online for free. The Java API itself contains thousands of coding tutorials coupled with the vast amount of skill-share websites out there makes this something achievable with hard work and motivation. 

## Outcome:

If the project turns out to be a success, it may become something that can be monetised. Depending on the reception from it’s target audience, it may even build a reputation for the developers involved – aiding in future job prospects and self development opportunities. The skills required to build a complex functioning software carry over through to all aspects of coding whether it be deep learning algorithms or developing systems with python scripts.
